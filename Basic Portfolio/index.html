			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/hawaii.jpg" class="auth-image">

			<p>A highly motivated individual looking for a home in the world of code.  I am true to myself in code as I am in life as an Artist with a Builders touch.  My primary goal is to write elegant code which results in an eye catching and simplistic user experience.</p>

			<p>In my personal life I am a thrill seeker who also enjoys a quiet life with my family and pets.  A long-term personal goal of mine is to have my very own farm so that space is never the reason I turn down a rescue.  I would love to be able to sponsor a resuce at some point in my life down the line to truly make a difference.  Some of my favorite pastimes are riding my motorcycle and skydiving.  Although some have said I am crazy, in my experience, nothing else in the world is more freeing.</p>
